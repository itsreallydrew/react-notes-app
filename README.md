# Google Keep Tutorial Clone

This app was built following a tutorial from Udemy, which can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-react-development-projects-practically/

## Technology Used

- React
- Material UI
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Experience

The app is very simple but packs a lot of subtle tips. There are particular CSS choices that seem insignificant but improve the overall UI of the application.

Material UI is a good library that includes icons as well as other things that is very useful. Will definitely use it more in the future.
